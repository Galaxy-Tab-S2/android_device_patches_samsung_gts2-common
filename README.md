# Patcher for gts2 devices (Exynos)

If you want to adjust this patcher you can check out the template : https://github.com/CTXz/android_device_patches_templatevendor_templatedevice

NOTE: Since CM now officialy supports the gts210ltexx, this patcher is no longer patching but only used to copy missing defconfigs
